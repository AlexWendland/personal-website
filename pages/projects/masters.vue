      For my masters thesis I worked with <PeopleDmitriy title="true"/>
      on an area of Maths called 2-Category theory. We wanted to make these
      abstract objects more concrete via representation and character theory.

      This project was worth one quarter of my final years grade but took a lot
      more time than that. I had to read research level Mathematical papers and
      reinterpret what I understood from the papers in to concrete terms. I
      distinctly remember speaking to Dimitriy in one meeting, a little worn
      down by the whole process and asking why it all had to be so complicated,
      he said:
      <Quote
        quote="If it was more simple, it would be less beautiful."
        author="Dmitriy Rumynin"
        href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/dmitriy_rumynin/"
      />
      So I soldiered on, in this "o so beautiful" world.
    </p>

      In the end my main achievement was writing down a concrete interpretation
      of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%27s_lemma" class="link link-primary">Shapiro's lemma</a>.
      This provides a relationship between two abstract objects, though this
      relationship was abstractly constructed. I wrote down what the exact
      relationship was in concrete terms that you could calculate and in doing
      so proved the objects had a stronger relationship. This work got published
      in
      <a class="link-primary link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870818303347">Advances in Mathematics</a>
      in 2018.

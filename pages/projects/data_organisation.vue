    <p class="pb-2">
      When I joined <PlacesCCData/> in 2020, the data function was decentralized,
      with data analysts from different teams working on disparate projects.
      Shared resources such as a GitHub repository, servers, and surveillance
      applications were managed haphazardly. Multiple problems resulted from
      this disjointed approach, such as code duplication, inefficient resource
      allocation, and a lack of shared best practices. Moreover, some critical
      revenue-generating processes were solely known by specific staff,
      preventing them from taking a proper holiday.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      My primary task was to streamline the data organization, fostering a more
      collaborative and efficient environment. I aimed to resolve the prevalent
      problems of duplication of effort, lack of coordination between teams,
      inefficient resource management, and absence of clear ownership for
      critical processes.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      The first step towards restructuring was fostering regular communication.
      I initiated weekly touchpoints and quarterly retrospectives to discuss
      shared problems, devise solutions, and track progress.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      To address the absence of shared best practices and code documentation, I
      set up a dedicated space on Notion. We created an analyst handbook, guides
      for our Kubernetes cluster, and documentation on resource location.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      To ensure smoother operations, I introduced quarterly time reporting for
      analysts and forecasting of analyst availability. This improved project
      planning and made better use of the analysts' time.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      I reorganized the GitHub repository based on product, designating clear
      owners for each section to reduce code duplication. I also implemented
      clear ownership of shared resources and used weekly planning sessions to
      discuss any upcoming issues.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      For a more robust application environment, I transitioned production code
      from development servers to a Kubernetes cluster, segregating development
      and production environments.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      To further improve code quality and collaboration, I developed libraries
      for common functions, implemented pre-commit hooks for code
      standardization, and fostered a similar coding style across teams.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      These changes brought significant improvements to CC-Data's operations.
      The migration to Kubernetes improved visibility of code-related issues,
      enabling proactive problem resolution before clients were impacted. Having
      clear resource ownership provided the DevOps team with precise points of
      contact, leading to more efficient issue resolution and cost savings.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      The introduction of regular team meetings and time reporting improved
      project planning, enabling teams to work together more effectively. It
      also helped to ensure continuous operation, even during prolonged staff
      absences.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      The Notion documentation and standardized code practices reduced the time
      spent on rediscovering resources and reworking previously done projects.
      It also facilitated inter-team collaboration and improved the efficiency
      of processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The changes I introduced at CC-Data led to a more collaborative and
      efficient environment, improving operations, enhancing client
      satisfaction, and ultimately increasing productivity.

      While I was at <PlacesCCData/>, a baffling
      thought struck me: What really happens when we enter a website's address
      into our browser? Astonishingly, I didn't have a clear answer, even though
      I was part of a tech firm with a primary product accessed via a website.

    <p class="pb-2">
      This sparked a curiosity in me. I wanted to delve deeper into the
      intricate workings of the internet and truly grasp the mechanics of
      websites. My goal was twofold: to host my own website, thereby enhancing
      my understanding of the process, and to comprehend the challenges and
      priorities of web developers.

    <p class="pb-2">
      I envisioned my website (this website!) as an interactive CV, doubling as
      a platform for other projects. My aim was to gain at least foundational
      knowledge across the entire web stack.

    <p class="pb-2">
      My choice for this endeavor was
      <a href="https://nuxt.com/" class="link link-primary">Nuxt.js</a>. This
      framework facilitates building
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/" class="link link-primary">Vue.js</a>
      applications seamlessly. One of its standout features is its unique
      universal rendering system, which I believed would be resilient over time.
      Moreover, its ease in page creation appealed to me, especially since my
      <NuxtLink class="link link-primary" to="/projects/mimir">previous experience</NuxtLink> with
      <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" class="link link-primary">Django</a>
      felt somewhat cumbersome. However, one minor hiccup I encountered with
      Nuxt.js was its limited plugin support, perhaps owing to its multi-layered
      framework nature.

      Embarking on this website creation journey has been enlightening and is an
      ongoing learning curve for me. It's crystallized my understanding that, at
      its core, the internet consists of API endpoints delivering HTML,
      JavaScript, or raw data. Subsequently, it's the browser's responsibility
      to weave this information into the websites we interact with. The
      proliferation of mobile devices has added layers of complexity to web
      development. Ensuring responsive design across devices can be challenging.
      Nonetheless, tools like Google Chrome's developer utilities offer immense
      support. With features like "Inspect", one can even playfully tweak major
      websites, making the entire process quite engaging!

      During my Ph.D. studies, I was fortunate to secure EPSRC funding for a
      3-month internship at
      <a href="https://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/" class="link link-primary">the Center for Science and Policy</a>
      (CSaP), a prominent organization bridging the gap between governmental
      agencies and university researchers to address pivotal policy questions.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-2">
      My role at CSaP was two-fold. Firstly, it involved getting actively
      involved in the day to day operations of the organisation: organising
      events, facilitating meetings between policy officials and academics, and
      writing stories about policy developments. Secondly, it required me to
      apply my technical skills to develop tools to improve internal processes
      and utilisation of CSaP's data within the organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of content creation, I published a series of articles on CSaP's
      platform:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        One piece explored <a href="https://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/news/article-how-business-learning-cooperate-pursuit-climate-ac/" class="link link-primary">how businesses were adapting to the urgent need for climate change mitigation</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another article delved into the <a href="https://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/news/article-what-online-manipulation-and-how-regulate-against-/" class="link link-primary">challenge of online manipulation and potential regulatory responses</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, I tackled the complex issue of <a href="https://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/news/article-what-are-challenges-developing-new-approach-how-we/" class="link link-primary">how we assess the value of services that bring public good</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pb-2">
      On the technical front, I embarked on a self-taught journey into Natural
      Language Processing. I developed a model capable of matching policy
      officials' questions to the appropriate academics based on their past
      meetings, CSaP news stories written about them, and their professional
      bios.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-2">
      Additionally, recognizing the organization's need for effective data
      management, I built several tools to help them access and retrieve
      meaningful information from their database. This initiative not only
      streamlined their operations but also generated significant cost savings
      by reducing the need for temporary staff to generate infographics and
      other data-heavy outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tools I developed significantly enhanced the efficiency of CSaP's
      internal operations, leading to time and cost savings for the
      organization. My contributions in content creation provided thoughtful
      insights into relevant policy questions, fostering an informed dialogue
      between government and academia. These experiences not only underscored
      the importance of blending technology with policy discussions but also
      solidified my commitment to using my skills for impactful problem-solving.

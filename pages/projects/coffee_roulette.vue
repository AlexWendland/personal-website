      >, a competitive leadership program in the civil service, I recognized the
      impact the COVID-19 crisis was having on the cohesion within our cohort. I
      identified a need for a tool that would facilitate connection and
      engagement between members to counter the isolation experienced during the
      pandemic. The task at hand was to develop a simple, engaging solution that
      would strengthen our network despite the challenging circumstances.

      Using my technical skills and understanding of my cohort's needs, I
      developed a "Coffee Roulette" application. I made this in google sheets
      using the google script in javascript. It involved

      to manage and send the emails using the gmail plugin and a form for people
      to sign up and manage their subscription. This innovative tool randomly
      paired members for weekly meetings, fostering connections and encouraging
      regular communication among our group. This required not only coding and
      design skills but also an understanding of the social dynamics within our
      cohort and how to foster positive interactions.

      The Coffee Roulette application was highly successful, significantly
      enhancing social connections within our group during a difficult period.
      Its success was such that people requested I set up several similar
      networking initiatives within the broader Faststream community. One of
      these initiatives currently engages over 500 participants as of 2023,
      reflecting the effectiveness of this simple yet impactful solution in
      fostering engagement and collaboration among team members.

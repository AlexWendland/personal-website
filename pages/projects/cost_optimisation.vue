      During my time as Head of Data at
      <a href="https://ccdata.io/" class="link-primary link">CC Data</a>, a
      cryptocurrency data provider, we were faced with a concerning situation.
      Our infrastructure costs, based in
      <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" class="link-primary link"
        >Azure</a
      >, were spiraling upwards, accounting for approximately one-sixth of our
      total expenses. The cause of this unexpected increase was unknown to the
      senior management, creating a need for immediate investigation and
      resolution.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      I was assigned the responsibility of understanding the root cause of this
      escalating expense and devising strategies to curb it effectively. The key
      challenges were comprehending Azure's complex pricing structure,
      identifying the areas causing the excessive expenditure, and finding
      cost-efficient alternatives.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      I embarked on this task by first gaining an in-depth understanding of
      Azure's pricing structure. To ensure regular monitoring and identification
      of cost trends, I created a monthly report detailing all costs incurred on
      Azure. This report was later handed off to an analyst for ongoing
      maintenance.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      My investigation revealed that the main source of our expenditure was data
      storage. In response, I took several steps to address this problem. I
      eliminated redundant data and removed unnecessary storage accounts,
      thereby reducing waste. I also implemented life cycle policies where
      appropriate to ensure efficient data handling. In collaboration with the
      Orderbook team, I worked on minimizing the product's cost by scrutinizing
      various providers, exploring different data formats, and considering
      multiple compression types. I also educated the development teams about
      the cost implications of their actions to promote cost-awareness in their
      future operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      These systematic and strategic actions led to a significant 15% reduction
      in infrastructure expenditure, which translated to a 2.5% decrease in our
      overall costs. Besides curtailing the spiraling storage costs, my
      intervention also future-proofed our systems from similar cost-related
      issues. The teams now had a better understanding of the cost consequences
      of their actions, thus fostering a more cost-conscious culture in the
      organization.

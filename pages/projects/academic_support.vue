      One of my most defining experiences during my time at the
      <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/" class="link link-primary">University of Warwick</a>
      came from serving as the Academic Support Officer for the
      <a href="https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/maths/" class="link link-primary">Warwick Maths Society</a>.
      It was a period of intense dedication, hard work, and purposeful
      commitment to strengthening the academic environment within our community.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      My journey began with a simple yet effective initiative - I organized my
      comprehensive collection of university notes and made them accessible to
      all via
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5m63moxv6csy8tn/AACcPd2m7UPHeGIfUNpH_iRza" class="link link-primary">Dropbox</a>.
      This was a significant step towards enhancing the accessibility of notes
      to students, particularly those who were unable to attend lectures.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      As the Academic Support Officer, my role extended beyond mere note
      sharing. One of my primary duties included orchestrating revision
      lectures, both by soliciting the expertise of other esteemed members of
      our academic society and, at times, delivering them myself. The experience
      of standing before my peers, unraveling complex mathematical concepts, and
      fostering a cooperative learning environment remains one of the most
      rewarding aspects of my tenure.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      With an aim to extend our academic support beyond the confines of
      traditional lectures, I also ran weekly drop-in sessions. These became
      a platform for students to voice their concerns, ask questions, and
      actively engage in knowledge exchange outside the classroom. The scope of
      my responsibility did not end there - I offered LaTeX support classes to
      assist students with this typesetting system crucial for mathematical
      documents, and organized lecture catch-up sessions for those who needed a
      bit more assistance in keeping pace with our rigorous curriculum.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      Recognizing the importance of a well-rounded university experience, I also
      played an active role in other society activities such as social events,
      academic talks, and career events. This enabled me to enhance our members'
      university life in a balanced and holistic manner.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      My tenure as the Academic Support Officer marked a turning point for the
      Warwick Maths Society, one that witnessed a significant surge in academic
      support activities. The year I was academic support we had the highest
      recorded membership to date. The following year, the society had to split
      my role into two separate positions to effectively manage the expanded
      operations.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      The positive feedback I received, particularly for my revision lectures,
      has been incredibly heartening. Even years after delivering those
      lectures, I continue to hear from former members who found them
      instrumental in their academic journey. This reinforces my belief in the
      importance of shared learning and peer-to-peer education.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reflecting on my journey, I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute
      significantly to enhancing education accessibility within the Warwick
      Maths Society. My experience underscores the importance of fostering a
      supportive academic environment, a principle that continues to shape my
      approach towards learning and teaching today.

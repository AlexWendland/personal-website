      My PhD journey was an enlightening experience that made me realize my
      eclectic academic interests. The most challenging part was narrowing my
      focus to one specific area. Ultimately, I embraced my diverse interests
      and delved into abstract algebra, geometric group theory, graph theory,
      probability, and even a substantial amount of programming. My thesis,
      which can be viewed here, is essentially a compendium of the research I
      undertook during my tenure at <PlacesWarwick/>.

      The initial segment of my thesis endeavored to weave the concept of group
      presentations into the realm of vertex-transitive graphs. Such graphs are
      distinguished by their high symmetry, making each vertex virtually
      identical. Their automorphism group and transitive subgroups bridge
      directly to group theory. In group theory, presentations are
      indispensable, facilitating algorithmic actions and the application of
      numerous abstract techniques from algebra and the nuances of geometric
      group theory. Inspired by this, I introduced a presentation for
      vertex-transitive graphs, enabling the adoption of similar methodologies.
      I went on to demonstrate that every vertex-transitive graph can have a
      presentation. Additionally, I made strides towards determining the
      conditions under which such a presentation results in a vertex-transitive
      graph. This research culminated in two papers:
      <a class="link link-primary" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10801-021-01070-6">Presentations for vertex-transitive graphs</a>
      and
      <a class="link link-primary" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13317">A study of 2-ended graphs via harmonic functions</a>,
      both co-authored with my supervisor, <PeopleAgelos title="true"/>.

      The subsequent section was a continuation of my
      <NuxtLink class="link link-primary" to="/projects/masters">master's thesis</NuxtLink>
      work with <PeopleDmitriy format="link link-primary"/> where we explored
      the intricacies of
      <NuxtLink class="link link-primary" to="/papers#2-groups">2-groups, 2-characters, and Burnside rings</NuxtLink>.
      I proffered more elementary proofs of the results documented in the paper.
      This approach enabled us to infer a noteworthy conclusion about
      2-characters from a paper by Orsorno, a joint effort with
      <a class="link link-primary" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katerina-hristova-bb1152145/">Katerina Hristova</a>.

      Throughout the progression of my thesis, my objective was to demystify
      some of the more complex facets of mathematics and draw parallels with
      other better-established fields. The entire process was deeply rewarding,
      providing me with invaluable insights into abstraction and the art of
      problem-solving.

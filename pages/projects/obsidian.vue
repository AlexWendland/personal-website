      Once I transitioned to a professional setting, it quickly became apparent
      that I needed to elevate my organizational skills. This wasn't just
      because I found my memory to be somewhat unreliable, but I also felt a
      strong desire to bring more structure and direction to my life. While my
      academic journey inherently provided a framework, the working world
      necessitated a more self-driven approach.

      While it aligns with other note-taking apps like
      <a href="https://www.notion.so/" class="link link-primary">Notion</a> or
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app" class="link link-primary">One-Note</a>,
      Obsidian stands apart with its local hosting using markdown files.
      Furthermore, thanks to community plugins, it offers powerful
      organizational capabilities—from SQL-like note querying and automated
      review systems to fostering a space for free-flowing idea exploration.

      I've taken the initiative to host a
      <a href="https://obsidian.awendland.co.uk" class="link link-primary">public vault</a>,
      which is a curated collection of my notes and insights as I journey
      through my development career. Think of it as a peek into my cognitive
      realm, where I synthesize information from varied sources, with a keen
      focus on my core passions: programming, mathematics, and philosophy.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      As time progresses, my ambition is for this vault to not only serve as a
      personal repository but also as a valuable resource for those who share a
      similar backstory and path to mine.

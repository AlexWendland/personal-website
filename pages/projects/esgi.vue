      I attended the
      <a href="https://ecmiindmath.org/european-study-groups-with-industry/" class="link link-primary">European Study Groups with Industry (ESGI)</a>
      workshops during my PhD, first in the University of Bath in 2018 and then
      in the
      <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/events/145th-mathematical-european-study-group-industry-esgi" class="link link-primary">University of Cambridge</a>
      in 2019. These workshops provide a platform for academic mathematicians to
      collaborate with industries on real-world challenges.

      In Bath,
      <a href="https://www.heathrow.com/" class="link link-primary">Heathrow Airport</a>
      tasked us with exploring cost-saving opportunities via renovation project
      scheduling. In Cambridge, our collaboration with the
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory" link="link link-primary">Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL)</a>
      focused on strengthening image classifiers against adversarial attacks.

    <p class="pb-2">
      In Bath, using three years of Heathrow's project data, we identified
      challenges like staff shortages, weather-related disruptions, and project
      scope changes. Heathrow's project initiation patterns seemed arbitrary
      within their 4-year spending cycle. We developed a model to forecast time
      and cost overruns and assessed three scheduling strategies.

    <p class="pb-2">
      In Cambridge, we built image classifiers using PyTorch, categorizing
      potential threats based on their type and familiarity. I worked on
      adversarial training of a convolutional network model, ensuring it could
      withstand image perturbations. The team also delved into techniques like
      image pre-processing and attack detection.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2">
      For Heathrow, our scheduling strategies indicated potential savings up to
      5% of their operational budget. In Cambridge, we found that while it's
      possible to strengthen classifiers against minor image perturbations, they
      remain vulnerable to more aggressive attacks due to the complexity of
      image data.

      These ESGI workshops highlighted the value of applying academic knowledge
      to practical industry problems.

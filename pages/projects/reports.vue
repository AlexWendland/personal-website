      during my tenure on the
      <a href="https://www.faststream.gov.uk/" class="link-primary link"

      maintenance which was critical for potential amendments to the

        >Misuse of Drugs Act 1971</a
      >. Additionally, I was tasked with providing key advice to the government
      on the regulations concerning

        Receptor Agonists (SCRA)</a

      To address the constitutional crisis, I worked with
      <a href="https://owenbowdenjones.com/" class="link-primary link"
        >Prof Owen Bowden-Jones</a
      >
      (the chair of the ACMD) to draft a proposal to the Home Secretary and
      Prime Minister, suggesting a strategy for maintaining quorum and
      continuing operations. Regarding SCRA regulations, I worked with
      <a
        href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pharmacy/people/roger.knaggs"
        class="link-primary link"
        >Professor Roger Knaggs</a
      >
      to suggest a revised definition for research organizations, advocating for
      more lenient regulations to aid UK research.
      <a
        href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Graeme-Henderson-9381fe51-ca25-42ad-8262-66d1fb48bbf1/"
        class="link-primary link"
        >Professor Graeme Henderson</a
      >
      and myself also recommended changes to the exempt product definition to
      allow legal sale of CBD products. We further proposed limitations on
      psychoactive substance impurities within CBD, guided by the latest
      knowledge on their side effects.

      My advice helped the ACMD remain quorate, successfully hiring and
      retaining the required number of members. As a result of the advice on
      SCRA regulations, the government commissioned additional work to consider
      these in the context of all other Schedule 1 compounds. The
      recommendations on CBD are still under consideration by the government.

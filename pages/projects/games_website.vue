      I used to play a lot of games when I was in uni, and I thought it would be fun to bring them into the real world.
      So I decided to create a website that would allow me to play games with my friends.
      It was built using <a href="https://react.dev/" class="link link-primary">React</a> with the framework <a href="https://nextjs.org/" class="link link-primary">Next.js</a>.
      <NuxtLink class="link link-primary" to="/projects/personal_website">This website</NuxtLink> on the other hand used Vue.
      I found React was more my kind of style.

      during the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to my primary responsibilities, I
      was tasked with conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Pulse Survey
      results for our department. The objective was to assess the overall impact
      of the pandemic on our department and to provide actionable insights to
      improve departmental functions and staff morale.

      Using spreadsheet software I found areas of focus and teams of higher
      concern in the staff results. To convey this to departmental leaders I
      presented this in an easy to understand slide show building a meaningful
      story to guide people through the data. This involved not only data
      analysis but also understanding the wider implications of the findings
      within the context of the pandemic by comparing these to previous years.
      Based on the insights gained, I recommended specific actions for the
      department, ensuring they were evidence-based and effectively targeted the
      identified issues.

      The comprehensive analysis I provided directly led to the Home Office
      establishing subcommittees to address the issues highlighted by the Pulse
      Survey. This outcome underscores the tangible impact of my analytical
      skills on the department's strategy and approach during a crisis.
      Moreover, it led to active involvement in some of these subcommittees,
      further demonstrating my adaptability and commitment to ongoing
      improvement.

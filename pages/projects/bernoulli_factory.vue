      In the summer of 2013, I got funded by the
      <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/" class="link link-primary">University of Warwick</a>
      to work under the guidance of
      <a class="link link-primary" href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/latuszynski/">
        Krzysztof Łatuszyński</a>
      on an intriguing mathematical problem.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-2">
      Our problem was framed in the context of probability and had a seemingly
      straightforward premise - given a coin, the probability of landing heads
      or tails of which was unknown, how could we simulate other coins as a
      function of the original one? For instance, if the unknown probability of
      achieving heads was p, you could generate p<sup>2</sup> by tossing the
      coin twice.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-2">
      This seemingly simple problem turned out to be my gateway into the world
      of university-level research, introducing me to the art of organizing my
      time, tackling open-ended problems, and applying ideas gleaned from other
      papers to our investigation.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-2">
      Our exploration into this realm of uncertainty led us to devise an
      innovative algorithm for rational functions. We utilized perfect sampling
      with Markov chains, a method that hinged on the principles of probability
      theory and statistics. As our work progressed, we found that our functions
      could be used to construct an envelope of functions, which could, in turn,
      estimate any other function.

      In 2022, after years of rigorous exploration, our research came to
      fruition. With the valuable assistance of

      Ph.D. student, we published our findings in our paper

        From the Bernoulli factory to a dice enterprise via perfect sampling of Markov
        chains</a>.

      Reflecting upon this formative journey, I realize the value this experience added to my academic growth. My first dive into research was not just about solving a mathematical problem; it was about embracing the unknown, persevering through challenges, and ultimately contributing to the broader scientific discourse. This experience continues to shape my approach to problem-solving and research today, nurturing in me an undying curiosity and a relentless pursuit of knowledge.

      At <PlacesWarwick/>, the Student Staff Liaison Committee (SSLC) stands as
      the premier avenue for students to communicate issues and recommendations
      to their department. My involvement with the SSLC spanned eight notable
      years, with three of those years dedicated to steering the committee as
      its chairperson. This role granted me the privilege of attending the
      teaching committee sessions, the crux where seminal decisions regarding
      academic curricular adaptations are taken. Parallelly, I further extended
      my representation, championing the cause of diversity, as a member of the
      Mathematics Diversity Committee for three years.

      Throughout this journey, I underwent profound personal and professional
      growth. I honed pivotal skills in communication, negotiation, and
      interpersonal dynamics. My tenure saw the successful ushering of numerous
      impactful changes: the inception of gender-neutral toilets, the
      modernization of the computer suite, the provision of added travel funds
      for our PhD researchers, the roll-out of open-book examinations
      (pre-COVID) for chosen modules, and fortifying support for courses that
      faced discrepancies due to varying lecturer styles. On the Diversity
      Committee front, my contributions were key in the department securing the
      Bronze

      accolade. Moreover, I actively participated in crafting data acquisition
      strategies aimed at propelling our aspirations for the prestigious Silver
       Athena SWAN award.

      To represent such a vibrant community was an honor I deeply cherished. It
      granted me the unique opportunity to forge meaningful connections across
      diverse student factions, ensuring they maximized their academic
      experience. Furthermore, it marked my initiation into the intricate
      dynamics of a large-scale organizational setup, acquainting me with the
      nuanced art of institutional change facilitation. Leading meetings,
      echoing the collective voice of my peers, and liaising with the department
      imparted lessons that have enriched my professional trajectory
      immeasurably.
